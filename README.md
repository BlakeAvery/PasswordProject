# PasswordProject
This is a class project for JWU's CYB3038 class.
Requires TornadoFX, the version I used for this was 1.7.20.
I'd have this as a gradle project but I legit thought I'd like, use
JavaFX through Kotlin/JVM or something until I discovered TornadoFX.

## Build
The project can easily be built in IntelliJ IDEA. Just make sure
you have the TornadoFX 1.7.20 JAR file in the project root and added to the classpath.
Required JRE version is 11.
Ideally, I'd distribute this as a Launch4j application. Working on it!
